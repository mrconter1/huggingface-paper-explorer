## 🎯 What This Project Does

HuggingFace Paper Explorer is essentially a wrapper around the [HuggingFace Daily Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers) page. Its primary function is to extend the time range for browsing top AI research papers. While HuggingFace shows papers for the current day, this project allows you to:

- View papers from today (same as HuggingFace)
- Explore top papers from the past week
- Discover trending papers from the entire month

That's it! It's a simple service that does one thing: provide a wider temporal view of HuggingFace's paper submissions.

## 🛠 How It Works

This project is a straightforward service that:

1. Scrapes paper data from HuggingFace's website
2. Parses the HTML to extract relevant information
3. Aggregates and sorts papers based on the selected time frame (today/week/month)
4. Presents the information in a user-friendly interface

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

This project is entirely dependent on and inspired by the HuggingFace community. All paper data, content, and rights belong to their respective owners and HuggingFace. We're merely providing an alternative view of their excellent content.

## 🤝 Contributing

While this is a simple wrapper, we're open to suggestions for improvements! Please open an issue if you have ideas or encounter any problems.
