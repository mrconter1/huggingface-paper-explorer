## 🚀 Why HuggingFace Paper Explorer?

- **Today**: See what's hot right now
- **This Week**: Catch up on the week's most impactful research
- **This Month**: Get a broader view of recent AI advancements

## 🛠 How It Works

HuggingFace Paper Explorer is a simple service that:

1. Fetches paper data from HuggingFace's website
2. Parses the HTML to extract relevant information
3. Aggregates and sorts papers based on the selected time frame
4. Presents the information in a clean, user-friendly interface
